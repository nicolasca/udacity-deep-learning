## Projects for the Deep Learning Nanodegree at Udacity

This repository contain the jupyter notebooks for different projects.

* ## Bike sharing prediction
In this project the goal was to predict the use of bikesharing in a city over time.
To do this, we had to build a simple neural network from scratch by implementing ourself the forward, backward and gradient update functions.

* ## Dog breed classification
Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the project was about building a pipeline to identify a dog breed for real-world images.
For the process of learning, it was first asked to build from scratch a CNN, train it and test the model.
Then to obtain a much better accuracy, the use of transfert learning was allowed to construct a solid model. In this project the VGG16 was used.
